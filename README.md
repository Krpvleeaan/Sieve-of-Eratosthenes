# Sieve-of-Eratosthenes
The sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to some integer n,
which is attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes of Kirensky [1].
As in many cases, here the name of the algorithm speaks about the principle of its operation,
that is, the sieve implies filtering, in this case, filtering all numbers except prime ones. 
As you go through the list, the necessary numbers remain, and the unnecessary ones (they are called composite) are excluded.
